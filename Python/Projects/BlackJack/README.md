### Objective

**Beat The Dealer**. There are some misconceptions about the objective of the game of blackjack but at the simplest level all you are trying to do is beat the dealer.

Basic Blackjack Rules:

- The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
- Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
- Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
- If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
- If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
- Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.
- Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
- Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled and you only get one more card.
- Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands.
- Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet.
- You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.
- You cannot play on two aces after they are split.
- You can double on a hand resulting from a split, tripling or quadrupling you bet.
