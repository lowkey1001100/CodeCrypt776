## ℹ️ Background  Info

This is redux of a class assignment from _SEC 480: Accelerated Programming_. There is an `election.dat` which contains four colmns of data:
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `district`
- `number_of_votes` 

The Objective is to open the `election.dat` file, determine which candidate won in each district, and display the rsults. The `old_code.py` file was the original assignment that was turned in. The `new_code.py` is the redux.
